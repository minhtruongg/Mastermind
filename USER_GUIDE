Game Objective
Guess the secret 4-color code in 10 attempts or fewer.


Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Select Colors
Click on the color buttons (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple)
Each click adds that color to your current guess
You need to select exactly 4 colors

2. Build Your Guess

If you make a mistake, click "Clear" to start over

3. Get Help (Optional)
Click "Get Hint" button before submitting
The game suggests a possible guess based on previous attempts
Hints are especially helpful after a few guesses

4. Submit Your Guess
Click "Submit" when you have 4 colors selected
The game will show your guess in the history section below

5. Read the Feedback
Black pegs: Number of colors in the CORRECT position
White pegs: Number of colors that are correct but in the WRONG position
Example:
Secret code: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
Your guess: Red, Green, Blue, Orange
Feedback: Black: 1, White: 2 
Red is in correct position (1 black)
Blue and Green are correct colors but wrong positions (2 white)
Orange is not in the code

Winning and Losing

You Win When:
You guess all 4 colors in the correct positions

A congratulations message appears with your score

You use all 10 attempts without guessing correctly
The secret code is revealed

Playing Again
After each game, you can click "Yes" to play again
Or click "No" to exit the game


Tips for Better Play
1.Start with diverse colors: Try using 4 different colors in your first guess
2.Use the hint wisely: Hints become more accurate after 2-3 guesses
3.Pay attention to patterns: If you get "Black: 2", two positions are locked!
4.Eliminate impossible combinations: Use white pegs to know which colors exist
5.Don't repeat failed guesses: Keep track of what doesn't work


Example Game Session
Attempt 1: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
Feedback: Black: 1, White: 2
(One color is in right spot, two others are in wrong spots)

Attempt 2: Red, Green, Blue, Orange
Feedback: Black: 2, White: 1
(Two colors are now correct! One more is in wrong position)

Attempt 3: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue
Feedback: Black: 3, White: 0
(Three in correct positions! Only one position to change)

Attempt 4: Red, Green, Yellow, Purple
Feedback: Black: 4, White: 0
YOU WIN! Secret code was: Red, Green, Yellow, Purple

Problem: Can't click Submit button
Solution: Make sure you've selected exactly 4 colors

Problem: Colors won't add to guess
